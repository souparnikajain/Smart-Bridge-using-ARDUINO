# Smart-Bridge-using-ARDUINO
 This project Utilises moisture sensors and an Arduino UNO and adjusts bridge height to prevent flooding. IT also activates a barricade to restrict movement during water levels rise, ensuring commuter safety.
Due to the climate change and global warming, risks associated with floods impose greater damages to infrastructure projects especially in case of bridges. Destruction to these projects impacts local community and overall economy of the country. So, the overall goal of this project is to propose a design of bridge that will resist every kind of flood. Unfortunately, if a bridge gets affected due to flood, the aim also includes to provide mitigation measures. 


 Our model offers solution in two parts. namely:
 Part-1: Incrementing the height of the bridge to prevent flooding of the bridge and overflow of water on the bridge.
Part-2: Restricting the movement automatically at one end when flood occurs and thus making commutators aware of the scenario.
